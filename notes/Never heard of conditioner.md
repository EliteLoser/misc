When I was in the army kiosk, I picked up a bottle of shampoo, Natusan/Johnson and Johnson. A fellow soldier said "You a girl?".
I looked at the bottle of shampoo, confused. "Is it the brand? Hm, why did he say that...". I said nothing and just bought it.

A couple of days later I was wondering why my shampoo wasn't working properly and why the liquid was so weird in "texture". I tried using more and more
and after 2-3 weeks my hair was just weird. At this point I noticed the bottle said "conditioner", not "shampoo".

I then bought shampoo.
