# 1 PAI is not 1 PAI

These notes are about some observations I made as the owner of two different smart watches which have both been connected to the PAI Health app
at some point.
I use both watches daily, one on each wrist. Might as well, all the while I have two arms. This causes me to gain some deeper
insight into "PAI", Personal Activity
Intelligence, a method for measuring fitness age and how much your heart works during your life/days and/or workouts.


The study boasts that it is scientifically validated and it was
conducted by NTNU, a Norwegian university. The study is based on thousands of people over the course of decades, so it has quite a bit of value
scientifically and statistically - you might even say "great value". It's likely one of the best indicators we currently have.


Now to the concerns. In short: Differences in the measuring equipment.


I have anecdotal evidence in the form of my experiences combined with the degree of capacity for reasoning required to assess (not saying it's difficult). 
My two smart watches frequently differ during workouts by as much as 20-50 beats
per minute. One (Fitbit) is consistently higher than the other (Apple Watch) during jogs. The Fitbit also completely fails to pick up weight
lifting unless I set it to workout mode explicitly. Forgetting to set workout mode before lifting weights can cause me to lose out on up to 4-6 PAI
since I often go into the high zone, but without workout mode, the Fitbit will happily claim my bpm is 71 or 79, for instance, after a tough session
when I feel my heart pumping madly.


With both watches actively in workout mode, the differences are sometimes very small also over longer periods.


This is then easily generalized, and the concern that is introduced is how the kind 
 of measuring equipment the people in the study used worked vs how an Amazfit,
Fitbit, Garmin, Apple Watch, or whichever piece of equipment you use to measure now, works. I contacted NTNU and was told by a spokesperson for the
project (incidentally a member of PAI Health Norway...) that their study uses _derived_ heart rate values based on _reported_ intensity of workouts.
This was actually unclear to me after perusing their documentation. This reduces the value significantly, but the differences between measurement equipment
remains as a concern. If we fast forward 100 years, PAI participants today will have contributed to the data set with different (known) kind of wearables.
At that time, and of course quite a bit sooner, the research will have more value. Still not a bad idea, but accuracy in algorithms to derive based on
the inevitable somewhat inaccurately reported exercise intensity and duration becomes much less reliable than if my assumption that they used wearables
already back then (I was wondering how they could be _that_ forward-thinking in the 80's).


I estimate that if I connected the Apple Watch to PAI instead
of the Fitbit, my earned average PAI would be cut in half easily. The Fitbit has continuous measurements and this also contributes to differences, because
"everything counts" when your heart rate is high enough, while the Apple Watch only measures once in a while and has to be placed in workout mode. This 
typically doesn't happen when running to catch a train or a bus, or in my case even just a quick run you didn't really plan.


That was about it. It had to be said somewhere. The rest is easily understood by the target audience (small one, yet maybe not eventually, I
might contact NTNU about it and maybe suggest a "disclaimer" or similar, although they obviously don't make guarantees about longer life nor claim 
absolute accuracy and reliability).
