# "Infinite screenshot" on iPhone instead of the screen being locked

Date of publishing: 2023-02-19

"Infinite screenshot" is my term for when I try to lock my phone, usually to restart it because of weird bugs, by 
holding the power and volume up buttons, and instead of locking the screen, Siri comes (because I have the setting for Siri
on the button, otherwise, nothing seemingly happens no matter how long you hold) and you have no other option but to
release the buttons and then get a screenshot. On the next try, locking works normally. I suspect this is due to a monitoring 
wrapper around the OS, or parts of the OS, but cannot say for sure. This has been a problem for me since 2018 (when
I started to use iPhone...).
