Initially written 2021-09-01.

I just wanted to quickly share a thought that occurred to me about why people were consistently so wrong when answering Hans Rosling's
fact question about the world, significantly worse than random, as readers
of the book "Factfulness" are well aware. This note is for people who read the book or are familiar with the content; otherwise it has no or little meaning...

I caught myself, in the beginning of the book, when being tested on the fact questions, thinking "this is a trap, it's probably better than I think, otherwise,
why am I reading this book?". That might be why 
I guessed better than random. But what struck me was the eagerness to lean on the side of caution to be "respectful". Somehow, I feel privileged
being an income level 4 person and having been that for all my life. This affected how I tended to "want" to answer. It was almost as if I felt I should
be "polite" out of respect for the suffering of others and answer cautiously/pessimistically. It felt like optimism was unwarranted due to the gravity/seriousness
of the questions. If you felt like me, you can relate to what I'm saying. If not, then maybe it's just me...

Having said that, I hope that in no way diminishes the profound realizations presented in the book. I do agree with the "instincts" described, as they all
felt familiar in some way. It is simply a nuance I noticed psychologically in myself
when I was presented with the questions early in the book. I finished it yesterday. The tendency to be "respectful" or "polite" in the answers.

It could account for some part of the phenomenon with so many wrong answers.

Have a nice evening when next an evening occurs in your time zone, and be well, please.
