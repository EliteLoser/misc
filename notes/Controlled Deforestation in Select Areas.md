# Selective Deforestation to Build "Fire Streets"

When I heard about forest fires in California (seems like a regular annual event at this point), I thought about what a waste it is when all that usable wood
just burns up in the air (and so pollutes). Some context: 
I am a strong believer in sustainable forests and sustainable harvesting of lumber (in fact, make _everything_ sustainable, except bad things). As a kid 
I planted a tree, as part of a sustainable forest project, that I was told would be big in about 30
years. Something which in my 7-or-so-year-old ears sounded almost pointless, being so far into the future. Now, at age 42, I could have traveled 
to that spot to maybe see
a tall, grown tree from the tiny tree I planted as a child. This puts it in perspective. What I lacked as a child is the understanding of the constant flow
of time combined with births and deaths in society. I had not yet experienced "aging" personally - or observed (old people were essentially 
similar to aliens to the child version of me, not something that would happen to me).

Returning back to the present moment, forest fires are rampaging California, and surely other parts of the globe,
no doubt due to climate change. Denying climate change now is like denying lead levels in the
Earth were abnormal during the 50's when "leaded fuel" was in use. They were most decidedly not, but the giant oil corporations shockingly kept the 
charade going by hiring lawyers and endlessly spinning it around in circles, until sense finally prevailed and
got translated into law texts/regulation. Sense usually wins in the end, but it can be a very slow process. The
tendency to, and penchant for, pursuing greed is downright scandalous when human history is reviewed (the present will be reviewed as history later). People
repeatedly make what is plainly and simply _wrong choices_ ethically/morally. The motivation is often short-term riches for a few select individuals 
while the entire world suffers, potentially for decades, 
in the wake of these horrific decisions. Please stop burning down rainforests in non-sustainable ways. A memory of the fires in Indonesia come to mind, I forgot
the details, but that did lasting damage. There will undoubtedly be more scandalous behavior, but I'm putting a small voice to 
the opposite opinions. __Sustainability__ is 
one of my favorite words. It means so much, and is such a source of comfort and peace for all, when practiced well. The benefits are practically endless.

I keep digressing, so I will return to what I wanted to say in this text: Consider controlled deforestation of areas exposed to forest fire danger. I don't
mean 100 % deforestation, but building "fire streets" of a sufficient, scientifically determined, width and length to prevent fires from spreading. I believe
this might not be a completely novel idea, but I have not heard much about it, so I'm making this note for the world to consume.
_The gains are that the lumber can be used for industrial/other purposes, there will be less pollution, and less danger and
destruction to people and property_. Overall,
it is simply logically superior to letting it burn uncontrolled. I envisage things like firefighters radio communcating about "quadrant west D4
has caught fire, it will spread as far as fire street west Z13 within hours, and should then stop there, as
far as fire street Z25 east and stop there ... affected homes are in region bla bla ...". Imagine
the rest yourself. Ethically it is also superior to passively allowing resources to go to waste at the whim of mother nature, and in the process harming
people and property, as well as polluting.

In case this just slipped between the cracks in the political discourse world of the US and other affected/relevant areas - here it is as a suggestion!
It makes sense to me after having considered the problem, admittedly superficially.

As a side note:
The main focus politicians need to have in what they do is the _longevity_ of the policies, to achieve what best benefits society long-term. Short-term thinking
is obviously necessary to some (a quite high) degree, to handle practical matters, but the long-term arrow is what is important for "ultimate development".
Having read Paul Collier's
words about the tremendous prosperity, combined with sound ethics and logic, made from post-WW2, 1945-1970, makes me believe there 
is hope, if we can only return to pragmatism, as Paul suggests very eloquently in his book (The Future of Capitalism: Facing the New Anxieties - do read).

Did that convey what I had in mind? I get no feedback or review, it's just me here, so I will post this now. Edit: I posted on Facebook and actually 
got a comment. It was 
about potential "desert growth/development" in the deforested areas. This is a valid concern and should be acknowledged and accounted for somehow. I cannot
guide further based on my current information available. However, I do predict it will be "worth it" to have some desert zones. In an ideal world you could
imagine watering the desert zones and/or using it as farmland.


Be nice.
