# A hiccup cure with 100 % success rate on the individual producing this text

When I was a kid I experienced getting the hiccups occassionally, as we all do, I guess. With most realizations I had in life, I have a precise memory
linking it to one situation, but with this one, I don't. I estimate I developed the cure for myself after the age of 12 and that's a wild guess. Close to
the age of 12 is my feeling.

Anyway, if by some mishap you're here looking for a hiccup cure, or just satisfying 
some borderline perverse curiosity, I will describe a hiccup cure that works for me 100 %. It never, ever fails. Trusted for decades now.
(I remember forgetting about it once when I was very drunk and in public - a gas station attendant heard me rave about it and gave me sugar cubes,
one of the tips that never worked for me ... Actually quite often for a few years my wild trips out on town would end with
me getting the hiccups and forgetting the cure... Probably just as well. And that belongs to my past, not the present and presumably not the future.)

What I realized at age 12 or whatever was that while you swallow, you cannot hiccup. I had read advice saying to use sugar, getting scared, drinking water
(spot on!) and such, but had not found a way to cure my hiccups when they occured. Since I lack this clear, distinct memory of the realization, probably
because it needs several attempts to manifest as a realization, I don't remember how, but I realized that when you swallow, you simply cannot hiccup, and
if you suppress 1-3 hiccups, it will pass. If not, 1-5 will surely do it (breathe between and repeat).

One of the tips I read was something to the effect of "swallow three times fast", but this is hard to do without a beverage, so: 
To achieve this effect, it will actually depend on your "swallowing technique". If you create a (relative) vacuum between your mouth and
the liquid in a large glass
of water, or whatever container that is easy to "drink fast from", you can achieve a more rapid swallowing speed than if you take in air between each swallow
(also more intestinal gases later with air and incidentally "more sound" when swallowing, a "gulp", while the vacuum method
is almost without sound). This is sort of besides the point.

Carbonated drinks will NOT work! Not sparkling water.

To put it on the brink: If you get the hiccups, get a 0.5 L or larger glass of water and then take a deep breath when you have just had a hiccup and then 
drink as fast as you can as if your life depended on it (partly your sanity does...), try to avoid breathing for as long as you can and keep swallowing as
fast as you can. If needed or intuitively felt (in my case anyway), take a breath and repeat the process of swallowing until at least 1-5 hiccups have
been suppressed. Once you finish this process, you will, if your body is as mine, find yourself having cured the hiccup. This can easily be repeated (but
might disturb your sleep if you drink a lot of water close to bedtime!).

Be well.
