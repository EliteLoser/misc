# Definition of a hacking equivalent as a real-world event

Casually the hacker walks up to
a group of victims talking amongst themselves, walks close by while pretending to do something
on their phone.

Once sufficient proximity has been achieved, the hacker proceeds
to hastily bend down and shove their nose up the asshole of as many of the
people they can, while drawing in a nice, deep breath and giggling.

Then they take a picture of the asses and people reacting (likely with a
punch breaking the hacker's nose), send it to their group of peers,
and proclaim "I do it for the lulz", laugh like children and proudly run
home to post the pictures on Facebook so also their mom can see.

I don't consider that acceptable behavior, but it's all the rage with
the young ones! You know where to go for wisdom: 12-year-olds. All that
experience with "real life" (in some cases admittedly true to 
an unreasonable degree for some poor souls) provides
very unique insight. So ass sniffing is apparently cool and hip.

The really brave ones do a single-person frontal version where they
suddenly jump to their knees and grab the victim's ass cheeks, one
with each hand, and then shove their face into the victim's crotch. Gender,
age, race, etc. is irrelevant, it's simply the act of getting luls while
having a broken nose that's the rush for the hackers.

Btw, I am not a hacker.

When I was 15 I was an avid spokesperson against smoking and hated the smell of smoke.

When I was 19, I started smoking.
