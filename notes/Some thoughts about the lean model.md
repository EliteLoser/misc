# Lean Operations

I am an official white belt Lean guy... That said, the downsides I see are that stocks can run out because supply and demand is supposed to meet each
other exactly and this causes "low local storage" (except for in China, or actually there too: build and ship ASAP...). This has some downsides with regards
to stability and a concept I'm a huge fan of: robustness. I don't know if that's even a word, I have no squiggly lines to indicate it here on Github, but
the concept of being "robust" is as I see it vital for any business or facility providing services to others.

I could diverge into IT security and the state of affairs, but I won't. Suffice it to say the bad guys have the upper hand there as of 2021-05-11.

Being robust means being able to handle unforeseen changes. In my opinion, Lean, in some ways, introduces less robustness. There is less room for
time and thought, always pushing forward and progressing, forgetting the past quickly. Turnover employee rate in companies is an often overlooked, 
important indicator of how a business operates. Is it a bunch of trainees constantly in and out, more experienced people in and out, both, or a more stable
construction in man force? I know there's been done extensive research on the topic without really familiarizing myself with it in great detail, but I have
a memory that it takes 1-3 years to replace a "highly skilled worker", somehow quantified in a research paper, with progressive levels of productivity
during that period.

Productivity can go down for a myriad of reasons, too many for me to conceive or mention. Either in a business as a whole or in an individual or a group/team.
Personal motivation, circumstance, external factors, supply/demand, organizational changes, restructuring, friction between teams internally,
bureaucracy, suboptimal processes, poor communication (big one), etc. The list is endless.

One thing I noticed in "lean" companies is their eagerness to respond quickly and also, more importantly for the sake of this note, the eagerness to _close_
the ticket/incident/inquiry. People are measured on deadlines on low-level tasks as well as higher up tasks and they are inclined to close tickets prematurely
in my experience and opinion, simply because of "metrics", something otherwise highlighted as exclusively positive (for maximum financial gain). I would like
to mention Paul Collier's writing again in "The future of capitalism: Facing the new anxieties" and say that we need both governments and the free market, but
the market has to be run and based on principles of sound ethics instead of simply "maximizing profits", referred to as "utilitarian obsession with increased
consumption", seen in examples familiar to me, such as with Statoil/Equinor and their "conquer the US" effort (a complete failure, 20 billion NOK wasted). Equinor,
then Statoil, was focused on "exponential growth", something we today mostly associate with crypto currencies, I guess. It is not very realistic.

Some words come to mind: "Infinite growth in a closed system". That "system" is our planet, Earth. We need to balance it out. Fortunately a lot of forces are,
albeit often financially motivated, pushing towards a more "planet-friendly" future, with notable resistance from sometimes unexpected parties, for reasons
I cannot understand myself. Capitalism wants growth forever, we're now at a stage where we are seeing the limitations of a past-time system, capitalism,
being put up against artificial intelligence, the internet, more widespread knowledge and information, as well as disinformation. My impression is that
the world is utterly chaotic at this point.

Anyway, I have no big point with two lines under it, but my concerns are in short: Low capacity locally (storage of resources, or manpower) and the "rush"
it introduces on the workers within the system. It seems counter-intuitive with mindfulness and balanced thinking.
It also decreases the robustness of a facility or business in my current opinion. I will surely change my opinion on this
matter within weeks of having written this article. Maybe I will update you...

"Progress, but do it peacefully, in serenity and in harmony with the surroundings". That's from my own brain... Quote me freely! (Is there a comma error there?
I'm terrible on the "and" comma rules... feel free to enlighten me, it's been on my mind for a decade or two...).

Bye.
