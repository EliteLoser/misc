# Lean Operations ... And a Metric Ton of Digressions

I am an official white belt Lean guy... That said, the downsides I see are that stocks can run out because supply and demand are supposed to meet each
other exactly and this causes "low local storage" (except for in China, or actually there too: build and ship ASAP...). This has some downsides with regards
to stability and a concept I'm a huge fan of: robustness. I don't know if that's even a word, I have no squiggly lines to indicate it here on Github, but
the concept of being "robust" is, as I see it, vital for any business or facility providing services to others.

I could digress into IT security and the state of affairs, but I will offer only a few remarks. The bad guys have the upper hand there as of year 2021. I keep hoping it will evolve similarly to physical security and make it almost impossible to get control over a device. As of year 2016, as spoken about in the book Factfulness, written by Hans Rosling, terrorism was/is on the rise, ''except for in income level 4 countries'' ("the West"), where it almost does not happen anymore and is in fact lower than ever in human history. I want a similar fate for IT security. For security to mature.

In 100-200 years I think they/we will view today's status as barbaric and intolerable, and wonder how we even managed, much like we now view burning of witches and barbaric torture chambers, even in churches, in the middle ages. It is simply unacceptable that opening today's newspaper can cause your phone or computer to obtain malware giving someone else access to your personal data indefinitely. If I buy a paper newspaper I am at least quite confident that I can read it safely in the places I frequent, but this is not the case with the digital world. If you are a person of interest, there is really "nothing" you can do to stay safe without a massive organization and surveillance. It takes constant monitoring and responding to events. Basically you have to be rich and have IT security employees simply to be able to have basic privacy. Sadly, I appear to be of interest to someone unknown, which is why the topic is relevant for me.

I have a lot of worries regarding the blend of healthcare and IT. I keep worrying about getting a pacemaker, or a similarly vital device, with Bluetooth or some other radio technology that's designed for updates, of course, and then getting hacked by the youngster next door who thinks it looks like fun to tamper with this device. Needless to say, the consequences can be grave. Not to mention the potential use related to terrorism, organized crime and crime in general, using the technological angle to hit a target. Maybe even without a trace. Park outside the victim's house, connect to the device, have it malfunction and then leave the scene of the crime. Something like that. "Pranks" can be bad enough.

In a meeting today, a coworker showed me a cartoon with a heading that read "If people in healthcare worked like they do in IT", where a person asked about a piece of medical equipment and if it still is in use. The response then was "let's turn it off and see who screams" - and you saw a patient in a hospital bed, looking scared, next to what looked like a heart rate monitor. This probably sounds familiar to many with IT experience. This is one part of the problem when they mix. That said, I believe we will overcome this and find workable solutions for most people, but I predict decades ahead of considerable chaos in this arena. Fortunately the world appears to be collectively maturing and taking security seriously. If you are a person of interest to someone with resources, you might be in for a bumpy ride, though. The problem today is the plethora of attack vectors that exists in almost all software. This desperately needs to be fixed. Where health and IT blend, this becomes extra troublesome, and it's not only about privacy concerns, as my example about the pacemaker illustrates.

Back to Lean, being robust means being able to handle unforeseen changes. In my opinion, Lean, in some ways, introduces less robustness. There is less room for time and thought, always pushing forward and progressing, forgetting the past quickly, although the framework obviously is supposed to learn and implement the learning in some kind of model.

About that, I'm currently reading a book by Dan Levy called "Maxims for Analytical Thinking" based on Richard Zeckhauser's teachings (I like it so far, 11 % into it). This vaguely reminds me of one maxim about complexity. According to Zechhauser, if a model can supposedly account for scenarios that cannot be explained by the result, then it is likely not a valid/good model (not doing them justice with this synopsis, maybe I got it wrong...).  It occurred to me that it might be difficult in practice to have a model learn without producing unexpected results, but I have some difficulty seeing the overall picture, because you can implement business processes that adapt and change based on reality, meaning they learn, but maybe the result by such a model will precisely be possible to explain. I digress a bit with the book fresh on my mind. But what I took away from it on the first read was not to trust results that defy reason simply because it is from a complex/advanced/sophisticated model. "Don't outsource thinking". I should have read this part over before posting this text. Maybe I will update it later, it's getting close to my bedtime. Another digression.

Turnover employee rate in companies is a sometimes overlooked, 
important indicator of how a business operates. Is it a bunch of trainees constantly in and out, more experienced people in and out, both, or a more stable
construction in man force? I know there's been done extensive research on the topic without really familiarizing myself with it in great detail, but I have
a memory that it takes 1-3 years to replace a "highly skilled worker", somehow quantified in a research paper, with progressive levels of productivity
during that period. Yet another digression.

Productivity can go down for a myriad of reasons, too many for me to conceive or mention. Either in a business as a whole or in an individual or a group/team.
Personal motivation, circumstance, external factors, supply/demand, organizational changes, restructuring, friction between teams internally,
bureaucracy, suboptimal processes, poor communication (big one), etc. The list is endless.

One thing I noticed in "lean" companies is their eagerness to respond quickly and also, more importantly for the sake of this note, the eagerness to _close_
the ticket/incident/inquiry. People are measured on deadlines on low-level tasks as well as higher up tasks and they are inclined to close tickets prematurely
in my experience and opinion, simply because of "metrics", something otherwise highlighted as exclusively positive (for maximum financial gain).

Some words come to mind: "Infinite growth in a closed system". That "system" is our planet, Earth. We need to balance it out. Fortunately a lot of forces are,
albeit often financially motivated, pushing towards a more "planet-friendly" future, with notable resistance from sometimes unexpected parties, for reasons
I cannot understand myself. Capitalism wants growth forever, we're now at a stage where we are seeing the limitations of a past-time system, capitalism,
being put up against artificial intelligence, the internet, more widespread knowledge and information, as well as disinformation. Not to mention
Quantitative Ease, the debt spiral we are currently caught in. At this point you can wonder "does debt size even matter", since it seems
disconnected from economic reality. Maybe we will all sit down in a pow-wow in 10 years and wipe the debt slate clean to give
the economies a reboot. My impression is that the world is utterly chaotic at this point, but it is indubitably no different from before in that respect. It has always been chaos. Likely it is "bad, but better", a phrase I picked up from Hans Rosling, which I find applies to a ''lot'' of concepts.

I have no big point with two lines under it, but my concerns are in short: Low capacity locally (storage of resources, or manpower) and the "rush" it introduces on the workers within the system. It seems counter-intuitive with mindfulness and balanced thinking. It also decreases the robustness of a facility or business in my current opinion.

"Progress, but do it peacefully, in serenity and in harmony with the surroundings". That's from my own brain... Quote me freely! 
(Is there a comma error there? I'm terrible with the "and" comma rules... Feel free to enlighten me, it's been on my mind for a decade or two...).

So allow a fatter ass on the companies/organizations in order to survive famine better? Ok...

Au revoir. And be good, so you deserve to be well.
