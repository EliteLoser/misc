The bug has been this way for at least some months and across phones/reinstalls, so I'm documenting it in the hope that it will be fixed.

Description/steps to reproduce: Install Microsoft Authenticator on the latest version of iOS (currently 17.4.1).
 Add an account using "Sign in with Microsoft" (side note/bug: The first account
set up sync despite me skipping it, the second did not...). Then, add another account using "Sign in with Microsoft". You will be taken to a logon 
screen where the email/username is already filled out with the previous account - and there is no way to proceed or change it. If you then go back and 
then try again, you are then allowed to enter the second/alternate account name. Repeated behaviour for third account.

This is (presumably) not a critical bug related to security (could be, but unlikely), but more of a "convenience bug". It makes the app harder to use 
during the setup phase.

Take care. Thanks.
