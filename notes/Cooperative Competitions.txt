Svendsen Tech Cooperative Competitions Concept

Concept invented and initial draft of idea created 2020-01-11 and 2020-01-12.


Description:

Many smart watches such as Fitbit and Apple Watch offer competitions (pardon favoritism, it’s the ones I use myself, one on each wrist).
These competitions – I will base my example mostly on the Apple Watch competition design – are usually precisely competitive and declare a winner at the end. You compete for the most calories burned relative to your own individual goal (keep that), stand hours relative to a fixed number in the day and exercise minutes relative to a fixed number in a day (0-60 award points – 30 is 100 %).
Instead you could make a cooperative competition where you each contribute to reach a shared goal. 
This would stimulate such psychology as “I’m so lazy today, can you do 1000 extra steps? Haha”. I can’t imagine the ultimate ramifications or diversity that can be implemented, but the basic idea is simply working together to reach a common goal.
Both are either declared winners or not at the end.
