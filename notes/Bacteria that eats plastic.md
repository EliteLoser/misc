Found a note on my desk that said "bacteri...", and something was covering it. Wondered what it was about. It said "bacteria that eats plastic and releases a 
harmless and/or useful by-product". I have zero knowledge of the topic, but maybe someone will find it interesting unless it's already being researched.
I would assume there were a need for a third compound, or several more, to achieve this.

In a utopian version, you could conceive aircrafts spreading the mix (if beyond any doubt harmless) over an area "infected" with plastic,
such as deep in the soil, or junk yards for that matter. It would then transform the plastic into ... fertilizer since we're in Utopia.
