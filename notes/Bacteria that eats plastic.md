Found a note on my desk that said "bacteri...", and something was covering it. Wondered what it was about. It said "bacteria that eats plastic and releases a 
harmless and/or useful by-product". I have zero knowledge of the topic, but maybe someone will find it interesting unless it's already being researched.
