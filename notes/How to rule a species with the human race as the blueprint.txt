Not really in order of importance, just a bunch of loose thoughts now with holes any lawyer or whatever can poke in it, just need to start somewhere… Notes… The time horizon here is millennia ahead of today, but what a man can think today is not different from what a man can think two millennia from now, except we’ll get “math processors” in our brains and augmented reality seamlessly translating all known human, and to some degree likely even animal, languages, etc. But just saying this is “infinite” in time horizon, or at least meant to be. Of course colored by my time and the impact it has had on me and my views, but I try to place myself above “our time” and to be “timeless”. I don’t believe time is really anything we can describe or measure yet. Currently we depend on the pseudorandom decay of cesium atoms in atomic clocks to measure time in “our most precise way”. This is just a “nice coincidence”, nothing with real meaning.
 
1.	Combine concerns about societal decisions in response to economic/equivalent development, forces of nature and intelligently formed action (currently human action such as terror and war) with the impact it has emotionally and socially on the population when implementing the measures that are decided upon. Limiting the stress on the population should be highly prioritized while still achieving the goals you need, such as building protection against floods and including, but not limited to, things of that nature.
2.	Make life for the population as pleasant as possible while still stimulating the natural things in the denizens that need stimuli. Intelligent thought is rewarding for many, exercise is rewarding for many, most people need to be challenged to some degree. How much will vary. These are examples among countless. The need for stimuli will differ from person to person, but there will be many commonalities. Grouping is natural, but should rarely be absolute. Always account for exceptions where such may occur, and this includes virtually anything.
3.	Exception handling is crucial. Some people fit in a category, but also fit in one or more other categories. There must be trained and intelligent specialists handling special cases. This applies universally across all segments of society, perhaps with a special emphasis on mental and physical health care.
4.	Assuming an abundance of energy, food and resources available - distribute based on need and desire. This is perhaps the hardest part to formalize broadly enough. Who defines the needs and desires, beyond the individuals themselves, given that someone has to perform the distribution. Make standard intervals/rations/doses, but account for exceptions also here (see point 3).
5.	Try to predict what will happen, and inform and warn. Neuroscience has proven that predictable pain and stress is less bad on the individual than unexpected events of a detrimental nature. Time horizon here may be a factor. Knowing “too long” (undefined, unknown and even variable) in advance may be bad.
6.	Explain and inform specimens of the race (people) who are subjected to treatment/anything of why, how and what will happen to a high degree, based also on the individual's desire for this information. See also point 3 about exception handling, but this is likely nearly universal for homo sapiens sapiens.
7.	War is unnecessary and detrimental and should simply be removed from existence. Maintaining a minor, obscure division that deals with (potentially “external”) threats of a generic nature may still be applicable.
