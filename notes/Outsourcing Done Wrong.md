Outsourcing gone/done wrong = No developer has ever ordered a pizza with the app they developed.

So you visit peppes.no, wanting to order a pizza. Nice images and colors... ok... We tap "Bestill mat" for å bestille litt mat da...

Of course we want it levert/delivered. Tap. So far, so good.

This is where the trouble starts:

Ok, this could have been done easy and good. Before I complained in a feedback form, they did have a "log in" option with 
face ID that worked, but that's gone after I complained (I think it's linked to my complaint that it's gone, 
lol... grr, world, communication probs galore...)

Except at this screen, if you tap your phone number, nothing happens... You have to enter your phone number digit by digit.
Kudos for at least a numeric keyboard on this one...

So we enter our phone number. Then entering the PIN code using a numeric keyboard should be easy... But, alas... It treats it as
a "new password" field, meaning your iPhone eagerly wants to help you with a new password. You have to actually choose
"other option" at the bottom, then tap "Choose my own password", and then switch from a regular keyboard to the numbers and some symbols
layout, to enter your PIN code (which I for some reason remember, thankfully).

And then we finally get here, where we can enter our PIN, the keyboard is not numeric by default...

![peppes_07](/misc/notes/imøges/peppes07.jpg)

We enter our PIN with effort...

![peppes_08](/misc/notes/imøges/peppes08.jpg)

And then we are logged in and ready to order (other bugs in the app of course, lol...)!
