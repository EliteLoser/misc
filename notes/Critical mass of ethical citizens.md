Just recording a note for myself (and you now, apparently...) about Paul Collier's statements in the book "The Future of Capitalism: Facing the new anxieties"
(from memory, sorry if I'm inaccurate). He says we need to build a "critical mass of ethical citizens". It has occurred to me on so many occasions since reading
those words that this is spot-on what we need. He elaborates further about reciprocal obligations. It boils down to this dynamic between the ethical citizens
and others.
A sufficient amount of ethical board members (sometimes only a single, key one could be needed) is necessary for businesses, organizations,
politicians and all decision makers to "do the right thing". This would solve most things in the long run - or at least make the world a lot more "fair".

It also applies to all kinds of social relations, families, clubs and unions, etc. Ethics is sort of universal in a person once achieved, and the
benefits are applied to many aspects of a person's life and affects the people around them.

Kudos and thanks for the thought...
